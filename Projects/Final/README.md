# CONTROLS
 <- Moves ball to the left

 -> Moves ball to the right (Moving ball from side to side also reduces speed/velocity)

 |
 V  Moves the ball downwards faster

Every time a wall clears the screen you will gain 2 points, and every time you hit one you will lose points

Difficulty increases as you gain points

The yellow jump pads can boost the ball up or remove all of its speed

# DESIGNER STATEMENT 12/04/19

My inspiration for this project came from discovering 3-D objects in the reference library. Originally I wanted to make a 3-D portrait that resembled a stained glass window, but I instead to just make a more detailed drawing overall. 

I began by making an illustrator file that was the size of a typical high definition screen. Once I drew my portrait I had all the points I needed to begin  the coding process. My color choices are loosely based on heat-map patterns. The cooler parts such as hair are blues, and the warmer parts are reds. Each range has 3 colors The darker is set for the stroke outlines and the lighter two are for the normal color and the shaded areas. The stroke weight choices carried over my inspiration from stained glass, and all the outline strokes are thicker than the interior ones. The background is black and inorganic objects are white so they stick out from it. 

Coding was fairly straightforward; the things I wanted hidden I put in first and everything after would obstruct them properly. The background is made from two loops functions that make square patterns. I set up a variable for each of my colors to save me the trouble of remembering HEX codes. Originally more curved lines were going to be used, but once I realized that curves require a lot of trail and error that idea was scrapped. I instead decided to make a more complex geometric image with irregular outlines to the shapes I had created. The process was simple, but very tedious. I realized quickly that a single capitalization error could break all of my code. 

I enjoyed coding this project because I had to think about the layering process and the order in which it was read. If I had more time I would love to make the portrait into a 3-D shape like I had originally intended to, but I am very pleased with how it came out.
